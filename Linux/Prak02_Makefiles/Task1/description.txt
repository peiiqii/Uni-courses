Your task is to create the following C++-project using a Makefile:

Create a static library hello_world.a that contains a function void hello(). This function prints out “Hello World”.

Create the main program main.cpp, that uses the library above and calls the function void hello() at least once.

The Makefile should only contain automatic rules that compile and link the project
